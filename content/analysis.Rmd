This comes from the file `content/analysis.Rmd`.

We describe here our detailed data analysis.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
print(getwd())
load(here::here("dataset-ignore/clean_wage.RData"))
print(ls())
```

## Motivation
    As senior students, we often question ourselves about what we are doing right now. What those 22 years of education could bring us in the future? Money? Fame? We want to be rich but we don’t know if all those years of hard-work could lead to a rich life. Therefore, we want to explore the relationship between wage and education.
    We also noticed that sexism is a huge issue in society, especially when it comes to wage. So we are also interested in the factors that result in the wage difference in terms of gender.
    Along the way of exploration, we discovered some interesting variables that may also influence the wage. So we’re going to build models to predict wages based on those variables.

## Breadth and depth of data analysis
    We are interested in the relationship between wage and variables including education, sex, age, family size, weeks worked last year, english-speaking ability, marital status, ownership of bathtub or shower, and region.
    The questions are trying to answer are:
      1. What factors are significant to predict one’s wage?
      2. How does gender influence the performance of some variables toward wage?

you will


* Introduce what motivates your Data Analysis (DA)
  * Which variables and relationships are you most interested in?
```{r q1.1}
#the relationship between wage and education.
#what factors can influence one's wage and salary
```
  
  * What questions are you interested in answering?
```{r q1.2.1 variable: EDUC}
#relationship between wage and education
clean_wage %>%
ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(EDUC), y = INCWAGE)) + geom_boxplot()

```

```{r}
#creating the factor variables

#EDUC.f
clean_wage$EDUC.f <- factor(clean_wage$EDUC)
is.factor(clean_wage$EDUC.f )
clean_wage$EDUC_new.f <- factor(clean_wage$EDUC_new)
is.factor(clean_wage$EDUC_new.f )

#SEX.f
clean_wage$SEX.f <- factor(clean_wage$SEX)
is.factor(clean_wage$SEX.f)

#MARST.f
clean_wage$MARST.f <- factor(clean_wage$MARST)
is.factor(clean_wage$MARST.f)

#SPEAKENG.f
clean_wage$SPEAKENG_new.f <- factor(clean_wage$SPEAKENG_new)
is.factor(clean_wage$SPEAKENG_new.f)

#STATE.f
clean_wage$STATE.f <- factor(clean_wage$STATE)
is.factor(clean_wage$STATE.f )


```
```


```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
(lm_mod_educ <-lm(INCWAGE ~ EDUC.f, data = clean_wage))
```


```{r q1.2.2 }
#relationship between wage and education colored by gender
clean_wage %>%
ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(EDUC), y = INCWAGE, color=as.factor(SEX))) + geom_boxplot()
```

```{r AGE}
library(tidyverse)

clean_wage %>%
  ggplot(aes(x =AGE, y = INCWAGE)) + geom_smooth()
```
```{r}
clean_wage %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = AGE, y = INCWAGE, color = as.factor(SEX))) + geom_smooth()
```
  
* Breadth of the DA
  * Make sure that you ask enough initial questions to explore the different variables in your data.
  * i.e. Do you explore more than just one or two variables? Do you explore a few different relationships or many?
```{r q2}
#relationship between wage and education colored by gender


```
  
* Depth of the DA
  * When you answer one question, usually more questions arise as well. 
  * The depth of the DA is about coming up with and exploring the answers to these questions, often iterating the process a few times.
* Modeling and Inference 

  * You should also include some kind of formal statistical model and/or inference. This could be a linear regression, logistic regression, hypothesis testing etc.
```{r variable.f}

  * Explain the techniques you used for validating your results.
  * Describe the results of your modelling and make sure to give a sense of the uncertainty in your estimates and conclusions.
* Explain the flaws and limitations of your analysis
  * Are there some assumptions that you needed to make that might not hold? Is there other data that would help to answer your questions? ...
* Clarity Figures
  * Are your figures/tables/results easy to read, informative, without problems like overplotting, hard-to-read labels, etc?
  * Each figure should provide a key insight. Too many figures or other data summaries can detract from this.
* Clarity of Explanations
  * Do you introduce why you are doing each analysis?
  * How well do you explain each figure/result?
  * Do you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?
* Organization and cleanliness.
  * Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.
  
  
**NOTE**: Your Data Analysis can be broken up into multiple pages if that helps with your organization.
