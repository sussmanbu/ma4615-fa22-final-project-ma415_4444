This comes from the file `content/analysis.Rmd`.

We describe here our detailed data analysis.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
print(getwd())
load(here::here("dataset-ignore/clean_wage.RData"))
print(ls())
```

## Motivation
As senior students, we often question ourselves about what we are doing right now. What those 22 years of education could bring us in the future? Money? Fame? We want to be rich but we don’t know if all those years of hard-work could lead to a rich life. Therefore, we want to explore the relationship between wage and education.

We also noticed that sexism is a huge issue in society, especially when it comes to wage. So we are also interested in the factors that result in the wage difference in terms of gender.

Along the way of exploration, we discovered some interesting variables that may also influence the wage. So we’re going to build models to predict wages based on those variables.

## Breadth and depth of data analysis
We are interested in the relationship between wage and variables including education, sex, age, family size, weeks worked last year, English-speaking ability, marital status, ownership of bathtub or shower, and region.

The questions are trying to answer are:
1. What factors are significant to predict one’s wage?
2. How does gender influence the performance of some variables toward wage?
      
## Full Model
We aim to build a model that can be used to predict wage. The independent variables we are interested in are education, sex, age, family size, weeks worked last year, english-speaking ability, marital status, ownership of bathtub or shower, and region.
    
### Raw Model
We run the model1 with all variables above included.
```{r}
#creating the factor variables

#EDUC.f
clean_wage$EDUC.f <- factor(clean_wage$EDUC)
is.factor(clean_wage$EDUC.f )
clean_wage$EDUC_new.f <- factor(clean_wage$EDUC_new)
is.factor(clean_wage$EDUC_new.f )

#SEX.f
clean_wage$SEX.f <- factor(clean_wage$SEX)
is.factor(clean_wage$SEX.f)

#MARST.f
clean_wage$MARST.f <- factor(clean_wage$MARST)
is.factor(clean_wage$MARST.f)

#SPEAKENG.f
clean_wage$SPEAKENG_new.f <- factor(clean_wage$SPEAKENG_new)
is.factor(clean_wage$SPEAKENG_new.f)

#STATE.f
clean_wage$STATE.f <- factor(clean_wage$STATE)
is.factor(clean_wage$STATE.f )


```

```{r wage model1}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
lm_mod1 <-lm(INCWAGE ~ EDUC.f + SEX.f + MARST.f + SPEAKENG_new.f + STATE.f + FAMSIZE + WKSWORK1 + AGE + SHOWER, data = clean_wage)

broom::tidy(lm_mod1) %>%
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(., 5))) %>% 
  DT::datatable()
```

### Final Model
By looking at the p-value from model1, we decided to drop ‘state’ and run the regression model again. The p-value of some categories of ‘state’ are greater than 0.05 so we would analyze this single variable later.
Education 01 (nursery school to grade 4) p-value > 0.05 but we keep it because the p-values of other categories (of education) are smaller than 0.05.
```{r wage model2}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
lm_mod2 <-lm(INCWAGE ~ EDUC.f + SEX.f + MARST.f + SPEAKENG_new.f + FAMSIZE + WKSWORK1 + AGE + SHOWER, data = clean_wage)

broom::tidy(lm_mod2) %>%
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(.,))) %>% 
  DT::datatable()
```
Interpretation based on coefficients: 
Education: there’s a turning point at grade 12 (06), negative relationship before grade 12, then positive relationship after grade 12. 
Gender: the average wage of females is $4121 lower than males per year.
Marriage status: marriage’s wage is $3870 higher than non-marriage per year.
English speaking: dummy variable error 
Family size: negative relationship $-279 per year
Weeks work last year: positive relationship $773 per year

### Coefficient Breakdown
#### wage ~ education
```{r variable: EDUC}
#relationship between wage and education
clean_wage %>%
ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(EDUC), y = INCWAGE)) + geom_boxplot()
```
We noticed that at first, as the year of education increase, the wage is lower comparing with no schooling. However, since 
    
##### wage ~ education (by sex)
```{r variable: EDUC + gender}
#relationship between wage and education colored by gender
clean_wage %>%
ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(EDUC), y = INCWAGE, color=as.factor(SEX))) + geom_boxplot()
```

```{r female/male}
male_data <- clean_wage %>%
  filter(SEX==1)

female_data <- clean_wage %>%
  filter(SEX==2)
```

```{r EDUC_male}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
lm_educ_male <-lm(INCWAGE ~ as.factor(EDUC), data = male_data)

broom::tidy(lm_educ_male) %>%
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(.,))) %>% 
  DT::datatable()
```

```{r EDUC_female}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
lm_educ_female <-lm(INCWAGE ~ as.factor(EDUC), data = female_data)

broom::tidy(lm_educ_female) %>%
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(.,))) %>% 
  DT::datatable()
```

#### wage ~ age (by sex)

```{r q1.2.2 }
#relationship between wage and education colored by gender
clean_wage %>%
ggplot(aes(x = AGE, y = INCWAGE, color=as.factor(SEX))) + geom_smooth()
```

#### wage ~ marital status  (by sex)
```{r MARST}
clean_wage %>%
ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(MARST), y = INCWAGE, color=as.factor(SEX))) + geom_boxplot()
```

## Rubric: On this page

you will


* Introduce what motivates your Data Analysis (DA)
  * Which variables and relationships are you most interested in?
```{r q1.1}
#the relationship between wage and education.
#what factors can influence one's wage and salary
```
  
  * What questions are you interested in answering?
```{r q1.2.1 variable: EDUC}
#relationship between wage and education

```
  
* Breadth of the DA
  * Make sure that you ask enough initial questions to explore the different variables in your data.
  * i.e. Do you explore more than just one or two variables? Do you explore a few different relationships or many?
```{r q2}
#relationship between wage and education colored by gender


```
  
* Depth of the DA
  * When you answer one question, usually more questions arise as well. 
  * The depth of the DA is about coming up with and exploring the answers to these questions, often iterating the process a few times.
* Modeling and Inference 

  * You should also include some kind of formal statistical model and/or inference. This could be a linear regression, logistic regression, hypothesis testing etc.
  
  * Explain the techniques you used for validating your results.
  * Describe the results of your modelling and make sure to give a sense of the uncertainty in your estimates and conclusions.
* Explain the flaws and limitations of your analysis
  * Are there some assumptions that you needed to make that might not hold? Is there other data that would help to answer your questions? ...
* Clarity Figures
  * Are your figures/tables/results easy to read, informative, without problems like overplotting, hard-to-read labels, etc?
  * Each figure should provide a key insight. Too many figures or other data summaries can detract from this.
* Clarity of Explanations
  * Do you introduce why you are doing each analysis?
  * How well do you explain each figure/result?
  * Do you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?
* Organization and cleanliness.
  * Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.
  
  
**NOTE**: Your Data Analysis can be broken up into multiple pages if that helps with your organization.
