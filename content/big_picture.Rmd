## Why do we have to receive education? 

As a college student, although there are many interesting classes to go to every day, such as MA415, sometimes we stand in front of the classroom at 8 am and wonder: what am I doing here?  
I'm sure most parents have told their children, "You have to study hard, learn more, and grow more, so that when you grow up you can find a good job and earn a lot of money."

Therefore, our group is interested in finding out the relationship between education and income at the very beginning. But with the depth of research, we find out there are many more variables that need to be dug, such as gender, marital, and language influence.

The following data analysis is based on one year of statistics in 2020 in the US.


### Q: Is that really the case? Specifically, could higher degrees of education help us to get a better job and earn more money?

```{r q1, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
clean_wage %>% ggplot(aes(x = CCR, y = MHI)) + geom_smooth(stat = 'smooth', color = 'Red', method = 'gam', formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "cs"))+ labs(title="College Completion Rate after 25 vs. Median Household Income", x="College Completion Rate after 25", y=" Median Household Income")
```

Above is the graph that illustrates the relationship between states’ college completion rate and states’ median household income. For example, College Completion Rate = 0.4 means 40% of the students after age 25 can graduate from college in this state. Generally, we can see that when the College Completion Rate increases, the household income increases. It seems like a high degree is related to a high wage. 
 
It is true that college is a barrier to entry for many companies, and having a degree is definitely better than not having one. But the employment activities to be carried out by the university are often services that require a little networking, and it is rare to hear of a college student going into a factory as an assembly line worker, which is certainly not a common phenomenon. in a scenario where the structure of the market is gradually becoming problematic or distorted. Human relations in the service industry can be tasteless as well. There are simple multiple-choice games, or information transparency has devolved into a kind of opaque black box operation. or appears to be fair but, in reality, is not. In such circumstances, a service industry involving the human body may become extremely difficult to enter, which is one of the reasons for the current phenomenon of increasingly high financial thresholds in large cities. For example, the household registration system and so on are obviously contrary to the development of the modern service industry, but why will it become increasingly strong? I am afraid that the logic in the middle of this needs to be carefully sorted out. That is, under the current conditions, the university is probably able to ensure a subsistence level. But there does not seem to be a causal relationship with high incomes. Therefore, we might need further research to see whether there are any other variables that can influence the wage.


### Q: Does gender have an influence on the wage although the education level is the same?

```{r q2, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
load(here::here("dataset/average_wage_educ.RData"))
average_wage_educ %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(EDUC), y = mean_wage, fill=as.factor(sex))) + geom_bar(stat = "identity",position = position_dodge())+ scale_x_discrete (name = 'education',labels=c('NO Schooling','to Grade4','Grade5678','Grade9','Grade10','Grade11','Grade12','1  year of college','2 year of college', '4 year of college','5+ year of college')) +  scale_fill_discrete(name ='Gender', labels  = c("Male", 'Female')) + theme (axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 20, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
                                                                                                      

```

This bar chart shows the relationship between the education level and the mean wage of each state in terms of gender. Sadly, women make less money than men with the same years of education in general. The maximum medium wage gap of male and female is almost $10,000. But surprisingly, female wages gradually catch up with male wages during college years. According to a study, women outperform men in academic performance in college. So what mainly lead to this gap is the conscious and unconscious discrimination in hiring and pay decisions.


### Q: Despite being educated, how much AGE can influence wages. 

```{r q3, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
clean_wage %>% ggplot(aes(x = AGE, y = INCWAGE, color = as.factor(SEX))) + geom_smooth(stat = 'smooth', method = 'gam', formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")) + labs(title="Age vs. Wage", x="Age", y="Wage") + scale_colour_discrete(name = 'Gender', labels  = c('Male', 'Female'))
```

The above graph demonstrates the wage distribution in terms of age with different genders. We can see that for both genders, the wage keeps increasing until the age of 35 then starts to decrease at age 50. Therefore, we can call age 14 - 30 the golden time of making money, then 30 - 50 is the time to settle down and save the money for retirement. Additionally, we can still see a huge gap between genders acrossing all ages, where the gap is astonishingly large at age 35 - 50 with about $8000 difference.


### Q: What about marriage?

```{r q4, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
load(here::here("dataset/average_wage_MARST.RData.RData"))
average_wage_marst %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(MARST), y = Mean_wage, fill=as.factor(sex))) + geom_bar(stat = "identity",position = position_dodge()) + labs(title="Marital Status vs. Mean Wage", x="Marital Status", y=" Mean Wage") + scale_fill_discrete(name = 'Gender', labels  = c('Male', 'Female'))
```

With the increase of education rate, young generations’ idea of marriage has changed dramatically these years. In the USA, does marriage influence wage and vice versa? 

The impact of marriage on the employment and wages of the female labor force has been a topic of interest in the academic community. Above is a bar chart showing the relationship between the marital status and the mean wage. 

First, it can be found that married people can make more money than singles. Second, we can simply get from the graph that men make more money than women, regardless of getting married or not. Astonishingly, marriage has increased the wage gap between women and men, whether it is because of the stereotype of “housewife”, or because of spending time on their children. Either way, it is a perfect illustration of “marriage is not a ‘blessing’ but a ‘curse’”.


## Conlusion and Discussion
According to our analysis, our parents are correct. Years of education can indeed help us make more money, but only with high degrees such as high school degree and college degree. Despite that, age is also a very important factor in terms of wage. If someone finished college at 40, it might be harder than a younger one when finding a job with considerable payment. Lastly, gender is still a factor considered in getting paid. Whether this is because of the sexism in the society or just coincidence, this huge gap should be diminished. 

Here is our interactive page, which will provide you with a more concrete understanding of our analysis.

## Interactive
In order to understand this analysis and explore the income, educational level and poverty rate interaction, you can view our own explorer [here](https://xchen23.shinyapps.io/example/).
This interactive feature allows you to select a certain state in the U.S. map, and by double clicking the area you want to learn, the information about a state's median income, college completion rate and poverty rate will be popped up. It will be a great tool for us to learn about the general behavior of a certain state.
