<p>As senior students, we often question ourselves about what we are doing right now. What those 22 years of education could bring us in the future? Money? Fame? We want to be rich but we don’t know if all those years of hard-work could lead to a rich life. Therefore, we want to explore the relationship between wage and education.</p>
<p>We also noticed that sexism is a huge issue in society, especially when it comes to wage. So we are also interested in the factors that result in the wage difference in terms of gender.</p>
<p>Along the way of exploration, we discovered some interesting variables that may also influence the wage. So we’re going to build models to predict wages based on those variables.</p>
<p>We are interested in the relationship between wage and variables including education, sex, age, family size, weeks worked last year, English-speaking ability, marital status, ownership of bathtub or shower, and region.</p>
<p>The questions are trying to answer are:
1. What factors are significant to predict one’s wage?
2. How does gender influence the performance of some variables toward wage?</p>
<div id="correlation-matrix" class="section level2">
<h2>correlation matrix</h2>
<p>We ran a Correlation Matrix to see if there are any highly correlated variables. OWNERSHIP ~ SHOWER caught our eyes so we decided to drop SHOWER because the correlation rate of “shower” and other variables are quite high.</p>

Generally speaking, married people are more likely to have higher wages. However, we can clearly find the gender differences in terms of marriage. The wage gap between male and female is much larger for those who are married compared to not married. Therefore, it’s reasonable to assume that being married is associated with higher earnings, but its effect on male is much more significant than on female.</p>
