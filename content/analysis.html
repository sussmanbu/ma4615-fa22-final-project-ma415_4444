<p>As senior students, we often question ourselves about what we are doing right now. What those 22 years of education could bring us in the future? Money? Fame? We want to be rich but we don’t know if all those years of hard-work could lead to a rich life. Therefore, we want to explore the relationship between wage and education.</p>
<p>We also noticed that sexism is a huge issue in society, especially when it comes to wage. So we are also interested in the factors that result in the wage difference in terms of gender.</p>
<p>Along the way of exploration, we discovered some interesting variables that may also influence the wage. So we’re going to build models to predict wages based on those variables.</p>
<p>We are interested in the relationship between wage and variables including education, sex, age, family size, weeks worked last year, English-speaking ability, marital status, ownership of bathtub or shower, and region.</p>
<p>The questions are trying to answer are:
1. What factors are significant to predict one’s wage?
2. How does gender influence the performance of some variables toward wage?</p>
<div id="correlation-matrix" class="section level2">
<h2>correlation matrix</h2>
<p>We ran a Correlation Matrix to see if there are any highly correlated variables. OWNERSHIP ~ SHOWER caught our eyes so we decided to drop SHOWER because the correlation rate of “shower” and other variables are quite high.</p>

<p>Our final model enables us to use variables including years of education, marital status, ability to speak English, family size and age to predict one’s wage. Since all the data is from the United States, the model is only used to predict wages in the United States.</p>
<p>For education, coefficients tell us how much/less wage one can get compared to not having school at all. For example, the coefficient for EDUC.f6 (grade12) is 3302.14393, which means compared with no schooling, graduating from high school can increase average wage by $3302.14 per year. We noticed that the coefficients are negative from EDUC.f2 (grade 4) to EDUC.f5 (grade11), which means for those who go to school but haven’t graduated from high school, the average wages are less than not going to school at all. However, there’s a turning point at grade 12, from that point the average wage increases as years of education increases. We believe it’s because having a high school diploma is important. Receiving a high school diploma can help to increase wage, but education before that can help little. Moreover, those who choose to go to work directly may be able to gain more working experience compared to those who go to primary or secondary school for a few years.</p>
<p>We can also find that female’s average wage is $6492.90 per year less than male.</p>
<p>In terms of marriage status, the average wage per year for married people is $9377.76 higher.</p>
<p>Moreover, the average wage per year for people who can fluently speak English is $4303.86 higher compared to those who can’t speak English.</p>
<p>We find a negative relationship between age and annual wage; as age increase by 1, wage decreases by $329.32.</p>
<p>For the ownership of dwelling (tenure), the model indicates that those who rent the dwell have higher average wage.</p>
<p>We find a positive correlation between family size and the wage wage: if the family size increases by one, the wage can increase by $147.08.</p>

We noticed that at first, as the year of education increases, the wage is lower compared with no schooling. However, since level 6, which is grade 12, one’s wage increases as education level increases. We believe it’s because having a high school diploma is important. Receiving a high school diploma can help to increase wage, but education before that can help little. Moreover, those who choose to go to work directly may be able to gain more working experience compared to those who go to primary or secondary school for a few years. The graph also shows that there is a huge amount of outliers for the categories that have lower education levels. It is probably because individuals who haven’t received much education are quite different from each other.</p>

From the graph above, we can find gender does play a role in influencing education’s effect on wage: for most of the education levels, male’s median wage is higher than female. However, we did notice that the gap between male and female started to decrease since grade 12. Female’s median wage even becomes higher than male for “5+ years in college”.</p>

<p>We continue to analysis the the relationship between education, sex and wage by running a model containing education and sex interaction. The p-values of interaction terms are fairly small, which shows that the effects of education on wages are different between male and female.</p>

Wage increases as age increase from 14 to 30, and then decreases. Average wage is approching to 0 after 80 years old. Moreover, male’s wage is always higher than female. The gap between two gender is biggest from 25 years old to 50 years old: males average wage is about $8,000 higher than male per year.</p>

Generally speaking, married people are more likely to have higher wages. However, we can clearly find the gender differences in terms of marriage. The wage gap between male and female is much larger for those who are married compared to not married. Therefore, it’s reasonable to assume that being married is associated with higher earnings, but its effect on male is much more significant than on female.</p>

<h2>Conclusion and Limitation</h2>
<p>Our project provides a model that can help us to use years of education, marital status, ability to speak English, family size, ownership of dwellings and age to predict one’s wage.</p>
<p>More specifically, we find that receiving a high school diploma is quite important. Our wages are significantly higher after we receive our high school diploma. Our wages then tends to increase as our education level increases. Moreover, there’s gender differences between males and females. Compared with females who have received the same levels of education, men’s wage is likely to be higher. In terms of age, one’s wage is likely to increase till around 35, and then decrease. Again, men are likely to earn higher wages than women who are as old as them. For marriage, married people are more likely to have higher wages. The gender gap between two sex is larger for married group compared with non-married group. Moreover, people who rent dwellings have higher average wages. We also observe a positive relationship between family size and wage, and we conclude that being able to speak English fluently is likely to have higher wages.</p>
<p>One thing that we want to highlight in our project is the importance of education. Trying to get a high school diploma, and even a college degree is significant to increase one’s wage. Moreover, there are gender differences. Females are more likely to be treated unfairly if they have less education and been married. We hope our project can raise people’s awareness about education and gender differences.</p>
<p>For our flows and limitation, we thought that the relationship between wage and education would always be positive. But it is negative in the first few years of education. We tried to interpret the reason but we definitely could look deeper into that. Additionally, we only include data in 2020 to keep the data size small, but there is data of the past few decades. So if we have a better computer to run the code, we can look into and compare our models with different years, and our model could be more accurate with a larger data set.</p>
