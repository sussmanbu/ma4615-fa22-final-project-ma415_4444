## Our data

### Data1
https://usa.ipums.org/usa/index.shtml 
U.S Census Data for Social, Economic, And Health Research. IPUMS USA collects, preserves, and harmonizes U.S. census microdata and provides easy access to this data with enhanced documentation. Data includes American Community Surveys (ACS) from 2000 to the present. We specifically selected the data and year we are interested in. 

### Data2
https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/ 
ERS (Economic Research Service US Department of Agriculture) compiles the latest statistics on these measures and provides maps and data for the U.S. States and counties/county equivalents.

## Our variables

### Dependent Variable
INCWAGE (Wage and salary income): reports each respondent's total pre-tax wage and salary income - that is, money received as an employee - for the previous year.	

### Independent Variables
1. EDUC: indicates respondents' educational attainment, as measured by the highest year of school or degree completed.
2. SEX (Sex): reports whether the person was male or female.	
3. OWNERSHP (Ownership of dwelling (tenure) : indicates whether the housing unit was rented or owned by its inhabitants.
4. SHOWER (Bathtub or shower): indicates whether the housing unit provided access to a permanently-installed bath and/or shower. 
5. FAMSIZE (Number of own family members in household): counts the number of own family members residing with each individual, including the person her/himself. 
6. AGE (Age): reports the person's age in years as of the last birthday.
7. MARST (Marital status): gives each person's current marital status.
8. SPEAKENG (Speaks English)ï¼š indicates whether the respondent speaks only English at home, and also reports how well the respondent, who speaks a language other than English at home, speaks English.	
9. INCWAGE (Wage and salary income):reports each respondent's total pre-tax wage and salary income - that is, money received as an employee - for the previous year.	
10. STATEFIP (State (FIPS code)): reports the state in which the household was located, using the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) coding scheme, which orders the states alphabetically.
11. POVERTY: percentage of population in poverty in each state, 2020
12. MHI (Median Household Income): median household income in each state, 2020
13. CCR (College Completion Rate after 25): reports completing collage, adults 25 and older, 2020

## Clean data

### Data1
```{r Data1}
wage_data <- read_csv(here::here("dataset-ignore", "wage.csv")) 
```

#### INCWAGE

According to the code book, 999999 stands for N/A and 999998 stands for missing, so we drop these values.
```{r INCWAGE1}
wage_data_clean1 <- 
  wage_data %>% 
  filter(INCWAGE < 999998)
```
Then we drop the outliers.
outlier q0.75+1.5IQR=45000+1.5(45000-0)=112500
```{r INCWAGE2}
summary(wage_data_clean1$INCWAGE)

wage_data_clean2 <- 
  wage_data_clean1 %>% filter(INCWAGE < 112500)
```

#### MARST
We changed marriage status into 2 stages: 
married:1 
unmarried:0
```{r MARST}
wage_data_clean2$MARST <- with(wage_data_clean2, ifelse(MARST == 2, 1,
                                                        ifelse(MARST == 1, 1, 0)))
```

#### SPEAKENG
We changed SPEAKENG into 3 stages: 
doesn't speak any:0
speak well:1
speak a little:2
```{r SPEAKENG}
wage_data_clean2$SPEAKENG <- cut(wage_data_clean2$SPEAKENG,
                                 breaks = c(0, 1, 2, 5, Inf),
                                 labels = c(0, 1, 1, 2))
```

## Combining data
```{r combining}
clean_wage <- merge(x = wage_data_clean2, y = state_data, by = "STATEFIP")
```

## Saving
```{r write}
write_csv(wage_data_clean2, file = here::here("dataset", "wage_data_clean2.csv"))
save(wage_data_clean2, file = here::here("dataset/wage_data_clean2.RData"))

write_csv(state_data, file = here::here("dataset", "state_data.csv"))
save(state_data, file = here::here("dataset/state_data.RData"))

write_csv(clean_wage, file = here::here("dataset-ignore", "clean_wage.csv"))
save(clean_wage, file = here::here("dataset-ignore/clean_wage.RData"))

```

## Rubric: On this page

you will

* Describe where/how to find data.
  * You must include a link to the original data source(s). Make sure to provide attribution to those who collected the data.
  * Why was the data collected/curated? Who put it together? (This is important, if you don't know why it was collected then that might not be a good dataset to look at.
* Describe the different data files used and what each variable means. 
  * If you have many variables then only describe the most relevant ones and summarize the rest.
* Describe any cleaning you had to do for your data.
  * You *must* include a link to your `load_and_clean_data.R` file.
  * Also, describe any additional R packages you used outside of those covered in class.
  * Describe and show code for how you combined multiple data files and any cleaning that was necessary for that.
  * Some repetition of what you do in your `load_and_clean_data.R` file is fine and encouraged if it helps explain what you did.
* Organization, clarity, cleanliness of the page
  * Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code (without side scrolling), organize with sections, use bullets and other organization tools, etc.
