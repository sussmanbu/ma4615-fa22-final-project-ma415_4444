  echo = TRUE # Use echo=FALSE or omit it to avoid code output  
)
```

## Our data

### Data1
https://usa.ipums.org/usa/index.shtml 
U.S Census Data for Social, Economic, And Health Research. IPUMS USA collects, preserves, and harmonizes U.S. census microdata and provides easy access to this data with enhanced documentation. Data includes American Community Surveys (ACS) from 2000 to the present. We specifically selected the data and year we are interested in. 

### Data2
https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/ 
ERS (Economic Research Service US Department of Agriculture) compiles the latest statistics on these measures and provides maps and data for the U.S. States and counties/county equivalents.

## Our variables

### Dependent Variable
INCWAGE (Wage and salary income): reports each respondent's total pre-tax wage and salary income - that is, money received as an employee - for the previous year.	

### Independent Variables
1. EDUC: indicates respondents' educational attainment, as measured by the highest year of school or degree completed.
2. SEX (Sex): reports whether the person was male or female.	
3. OWNERSHP (Ownership of dwelling (tenure) : indicates whether the housing unit was rented or owned by its inhabitants.
4. SHOWER (Bathtub or shower): indicates whether the housing unit provided access to a permanently-installed bath and/or shower. 
5. FAMSIZE (Number of own family members in household): counts the number of own family members residing with each individual, including the person her/himself. 
6. AGE (Age): reports the person's age in years as of the last birthday.
7. MARST (Marital status): gives each person's current marital status.
8. SPEAKENG (Speaks English)ï¼š indicates whether the respondent speaks only English at home, and also reports how well the respondent, who speaks a language other than English at home, speaks English.	
9. WKSWORK1 (Weeks worked last year): reports the number of weeks that the respondent worked for profit, pay, or as an unpaid family worker during the previous year.
10. INCWAGE (Wage and salary income):reports each respondent's total pre-tax wage and salary income - that is, money received as an employee - for the previous year.	
11. STATEFIP (State (FIPS code)): reports the state in which the household was located, using the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) coding scheme, which orders the states alphabetically.
12. POVERTY: percentage of population in poverty in each state, 2020
13. MHI (Median Household Income): median household income in each state, 2020
14. CCR (College Completion Rate after 25): reports completing collage, adults 25 and older, 2020

## Clean data

### Data1
```{r Data1}
wage_data <- read_csv(here::here("dataset-ignore", "wage.csv")) 
```

#### INCWAGE

According to the code book, 999999 stands for N/A and 999998 stands for missing, so we drop these values.
```{r INCWAGE1}
wage_data_clean1 <- 
  wage_data %>% 
  filter(INCWAGE < 999998)
```
Then we drop the outliers.
outlier q0.75+1.5IQR=45000+1.5(45000-0)=112500
```{r INCWAGE2}
summary(wage_data_clean1$INCWAGE)

wage_data_clean2 <- 
  wage_data_clean1 %>% filter(INCWAGE < 112500)
```

#### MARST
We changed marriage status into 2 stages: 
married:1 
unmarried:0
```{r MARST}
wage_data_clean2$MARST <- with(wage_data_clean2, ifelse(MARST == 2, 1,
                                                        ifelse(MARST == 1, 1, 0)))
```

#### SPEAKENG
We changed SPEAKENG into 3 stages: 
doesn't speak any:0
speak well:1
speak a little:2
```{r SPEAKENG}
wage_data_clean2$SPEAKENG <- cut(wage_data_clean2$SPEAKENG,
                                 breaks = c(0, 1, 2, 5, Inf),
                                 labels = c(0, 1, 1, 2))
```

## Combining data
```{r combining}
clean_wage <- merge(x = wage_data_clean2, y = state_data, by = "STATEFIP")
```

## Saving
```{r write}
write_csv(wage_data_clean2, file = here::here("dataset", "wage_data_clean2.csv"))
save(wage_data_clean2, file = here::here("dataset/wage_data_clean2.RData"))

write_csv(state_data, file = here::here("dataset", "state_data.csv"))
save(state_data, file = here::here("dataset/state_data.RData"))

write_csv(clean_wage, file = here::here("dataset-ignore", "clean_wage.csv"))
save(clean_wage, file = here::here("dataset-ignore/clean_wage.RData"))

```

Your first steps in this project will be to find data to work on.

I recommend trying to find data that interests you and that you are knowledgeable about. A bad example would be if you have no interest in video games but your data set is about video games. I also recommend finding data that is related to current events, social justice, and other areas that have an impact.

You are __not__ allowed to work on COVID data.

Initially, you will study _one dataset_ but later you will need to combine that data with another dataset. For this reason, I recommend finding data that has some date and/or location components. These types of data are conducive to interesting visualizations and analysis and you can also combine this data with other data that also has a date or location variable.
Data from the census, weather data, economic data, are all relatively easy to combine with other data with time/location components.


## Where to keep data?


Below 50mb: In `dataset` folder

Above 50mb: In `dataset_ignore` folder. This folder will be ignored by `git` so you'll have to manually sync these files across your team.

### Sharing your data


For small datasets (<50mb), you can use the `dataset` folder that is tracked by github. Add the files just like you would any other file.

**Do not** use a folder named `data`.
This folder is reserved by `hugo`.
If you create a folder named `data` this will cause problems.

For larger datasets, you'll need to create a new folder in the project root directory named `dataset-ignore`. This will be ignored by git (based off the `.gitignore` file in the project root directory) which will help you avoid issues with Github's size limits. Your team will have to manually make sure the data files in `dataset-ignore` are synced across team members.

Your [load_and_clean_data.R](/load_and_clean_data.R) file is how you will load and clean your data. Here is a an example of a very simple one.

```{r}
source(
  here::here("static", "load_and_clean_data.R"),
  echo = TRUE # Use echo=FALSE or omit it to avoid code output  
)
```

Note how I use the `here::here` function from the [`here` package](https://here.r-lib.org/articles/here.html) to avoid path problems.
This function is used to specify directories within the project's root directory.
You should never use absolute paths (eg. `/Users/danielsussman/path/to/project/` or `C:\\MA415\\Final_Project\\`) and using `here` ensures that it doesn't matter what the current working directory is as long as you have this RStudio Project open.

## Files in static

### `load_and_clean_data.R`

The idea behind this file is that someone coming to your website could largely replicate your analyses after running this script on the original data sets to clean them.
This file might create a derivative data set that you then use for your subsequent analysis.
Note that you don't need to run this script from every post/page.
Instead, you can load in the results of this script, which could be plain text files or `.RData` files. In your data page you'll describe how these results were created. If you have a very large data set, you might save smaller data sets that you can use for exploration purposes.
To link to this file, you can use `[cleaning script](/load_and_clean_data.R)`. 


When you are loading in data, I recommend using the `here::here` function to specify the file path. This function is used to specify a path relative to your project's root directory. Hence, you can read a file using eg, `read_csv(here::here("dataset/data_file.csv"))`.


### Shiny Interactive

If you are using a shiny interactive, you'll need to keep that in a separate folder (i.e. not in `static` or `content`). For the shiny interactive you'll need to publish the app on `shinyapps.io` where the app can be run. When you publish, make sure to include any data sets you are loading in among the files you publish since those datasets will need to be loaded by your app.

## Rubric: On this page

you will

* Describe where/how to find data.
  * You must include a link to the original data source(s). Make sure to provide attribution to those who collected the data.
  * Why was the data collected/curated? Who put it together? (This is important, if you don't know why it was collected then that might not be a good dataset to look at.
* Describe the different data files used and what each variable means. 
  * If you have many variables then only describe the most relevant ones and summarize the rest.
* Describe any cleaning you had to do for your data.
  * You *must* include a link to your `load_and_clean_data.R` file.
  * Also, describe any additional R packages you used outside of those covered in class.
  * Describe and show code for how you combined multiple data files and any cleaning that was necessary for that.
  * Some repetition of what you do in your `load_and_clean_data.R` file is fine and encouraged if it helps explain what you did.
* Organization, clarity, cleanliness of the page
  * Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code (without side scrolling), organize with sections, use bullets and other organization tools, etc.
