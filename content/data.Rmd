## Our data

### Data1
https://usa.ipums.org/usa/index.shtml 
U.S Census Data for Social, Economic, And Health Research. IPUMS USA collects, preserves, and harmonizes U.S. census microdata and provides easy access to this data with enhanced documentation. Data includes American Community Surveys (ACS) from 2000 to the present. We specifically selected the data and year we are interested in. 

### Data2

ERS (Economic Research Service US Department of Agriculture) compiles the latest statistics on these measures and provides maps and data for the U.S. States and counties/county equivalents.

## Clean data

### Load data
```{r Data1}
wage_data <- read_csv(here::here("dataset-ignore", "wage.csv")) 
average_wage_educ <- read_csv(here::here("dataset", "average_wage_educ.csv"))
average_wage_marst <- read_csv(here::here("dataset", "average_wage_MARST.csv"))
state_data <- read_csv(here::here("dataset", "states.csv"))
```

#### INCWAGE

According to the code book, 999999 stands for N/A and 999998 stands for missing, so we drop these values.
```{r INCWAGE1}
wage_data_clean1 <- 
  wage_data %>% 
  filter(INCWAGE < 999998)
```
Then we drop the outliers.
outlier q0.75+1.5IQR=45000+1.5(45000-0)=112500
```{r INCWAGE2}
summary(wage_data_clean1$INCWAGE)

wage_data_clean2 <- 
  wage_data_clean1 %>% filter(INCWAGE < 112500)
```

#### MARST
We changed marriage status into 2 stages: 
married:1 
unmarried:0
```{r MARST}
wage_data_clean2$MARST <- with(wage_data_clean2, ifelse(MARST == 2, 1,
                                                        ifelse(MARST == 1, 1, 0)))
```

#### SPEAKENG
We changed SPEAKENG into 3 stages: 
doesn't speak any:0
speak well:1
speak a little:2
```{r SPEAKENG}
wage_data_clean2$SPEAKENG <- cut(wage_data_clean2$SPEAKENG,
                                 breaks = c(0, 1, 2, 5, Inf),
                                 labels = c(0, 1, 1, 2))
```

## Combining data
```{r combining}
clean_wage <- merge(x = wage_data_clean2, y = state_data, by = "STATEFIP")
```

## Saving
```{r write}
write_csv(wage_data_clean2, file = here::here("dataset", "wage_data_clean2.csv"))
save(wage_data_clean2, file = here::here("dataset/wage_data_clean2.RData"))

write_csv(state_data, file = here::here("dataset", "state_data.csv"))
save(state_data, file = here::here("dataset/state_data.RData"))

write_csv(clean_wage, file = here::here("dataset-ignore", "clean_wage.csv"))
save(clean_wage, file = here::here("dataset-ignore/clean_wage.RData"))

write_csv(average_wage_educ, file=here::here("dataset","average_wage_educ.csv"))
save(average_wage_educ, file = here::here("dataset/average_wage_educ.RData"))

write_csv(average_wage_marst, file = here::here("dataset", "average_wage_MARST.csv"))
save(average_wage_marst, file = here::here("dataset/average_wage_MARST.RData.RData"))
```
