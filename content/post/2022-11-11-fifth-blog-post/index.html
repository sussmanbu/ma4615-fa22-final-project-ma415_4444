<h2>Weather data based on dates, including demographic data based on location, among many other possibilities. please describe the datasets you are combining, and how you are combining them</h2>
<p>We found three datasets initially: dataset1 is the adult’s income dataset, which only consists 89 rows; dataset2 is the NYC Prison Admissions dataset 2008 till 2021 and dataset3 is an IPUMS dataset in which we combined the total household income dataset and Educational attainment dataset together. At this point, we decide only to focus on analyzing dataset3 to see what factors contribute to one’s income level. Besides the existing indicators that we can obtain from dataset1, here we like to introduce dataset4, <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE" class="uri">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE</a>, which shows the unemployment rate in United States from 1948 to 2020. We will combine it with dataset1 since we believe that Economic Trends can also play an important role in an individual’s income level. We will add one more column to our dataset3 named unemployment_rate. From what we have so far, we want to see if the unemployment rate affects the income of a person. If so, what is the contribution? These will be the questions leaving us to answer in the future.</p>
