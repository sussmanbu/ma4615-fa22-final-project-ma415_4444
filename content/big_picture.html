<p>Think of this page as your 538/Upshot style article. This means that you should try to tell a story through the data and your analysis. Read articles from those sites and similar sites to get a feeling for what they are like. Importantly, these should be geared towards the general public. You shouldn’t assume the reader understands how to interpret a linear regression. Focus on interpretation and visualizations.</p>

<div id="why-do-we-have-to-receive-education" class="section level2">
<h2>Why do we have to receive education?</h2>
<p>On October 11, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the three winners of the 2021 Nobel Prize in Economics. Perhaps we all once thought that the Nobel Prize was far away from our life, but this year’s Nobel laureates in the field of labor economics used empirical methods in their research to prove many major theories. For example, the more you study, the more money you make.</p>
<p>I’m sure most parents have said to their children, “You have to study hard, learn more, and grow more, so that when you grow up you can find a good job and earn a lot of money.”</p>

<h3>Q: Is that really the case? Specifically, could higher degrees of education help us to get a better job and earn more money?</h3>
<p><img src="/big_picture_files/figure-html/q1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Above is the graph that illustrates the relationship between states’ college completion rate and states’ median household income. For example, CCR = 0.4 means this state has a 40% college graduation rate for people after age 25. To be generalized, this graph can show the relationship between the income and education level: the CCR increases, MHI increases.</p>
<p>It seems like higher education can have higher wage according to this graph predicts. It is true that college is a barrier to entry for many companies, and having a degree is definitely better than not having one. But the employment activities to be carried out by the university are often services that require a little networking, and it is rare to hear of a college student going into a factory as an assembly line worker, which is certainly not a common phenomenon. in a scenario where the structure of the market is gradually becoming problematic or distorted. Human relations in the service industry can be tasteless as well. There are simple multiple-choice games, or information transparency has devolved into a kind of opaque black box operation. or appears to be fair but, in reality, is not. In such circumstances, a service industry involving the human body may become extremely difficult to enter, which is one of the reasons for the current phenomenon of increasingly high financial thresholds in large cities. For example, the household registration system and so on are obviously contrary to the development of the modern service industry, but why will it become increasingly strong? I am afraid that the logic in the middle of this needs to be carefully sorted out. That is, under the current conditions, the university is probably able to ensure a subsistence level. But there does not seem to be a causal relationship with high incomes. Therefore, we might need further research to see whether there are any other variables that can influence the wage.</p>

<h3>Q: Does gender have an influence on the wage although the education level is the same?</h3>
<p><img src="/big_picture_files/figure-html/q2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The above is a bar chart to show the relationship between the education level and the mean wage of each state by the factor of male and female. For our x-axis is the education level, the lower the number of x-axis, the lower the education level. For the factor in gender, we set “1” as male, and “2” as female.</p>
<p>Sadly, women make less money than men with the same years of education in general. The maximum medium wage gap of male and female is almost 10000 dollor in the education level of “8” which means after both finishing the 2 years of college, male can get higher wage than female. Of course some may question how even in one educational context, which may have been completed at different schools, this may lead to wage differences at the same level of education. This is a very good question, but there is a lack of data collection on the market on this issue, and we would be happy to collect data in a future study if necessary.
But for now, in a broad analysis, we retain that gender differences have an impact on wages.</p>

<h3>Q: Despite being educated, how much AGE can influence wages.</h3>
<p><img src="/big_picture_files/figure-html/q3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The above graph demonstrates the wage distribution in terms of age with different genders. We can see that for both genders, the wage increases until the age of 35 and remains the same. It starts to decrease at age 50 and slows down the rate of decrease at about age 70. Therefore, we can call age 18 - 35 the golden time of making money, then 35 - 50 is the time to settle down and save the money for retirement. Additionally, we can still see a huge gap between genders acrossing all ages, where the gap is astonishingly large at age 35 - 50.</p>
<p>With the increase of education rate, young generations’ idea of marriage has changed dramatically these years. In the USA, does marriage influence wage and vice versa?</p>
</div>
<div id="q-what-about-marriage" class="section level3">
<h3>Q: What about marriage?</h3>
<p><img src="/big_picture_files/figure-html/q4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The impact of marriage on the employment and wages of the female labor force has been a topic of interest in the academic community. Below is the bar chart showing the relationship between the marital status and their mean wage.</p>
<p>First, it can be found that married people can make more money than singles. In summary, both the absolute amount of female wages and the level of gender wage gap reflect the effect of marriage on their enhancement and improvement. Both the absolute amount of women’s wages and the level of the gender wage gap reflect the raising and improving effect of marriage on them, i.e., the same “marriage lift” in women’s wages. It seems logical that there is also a “marital uptick” in women’s wages.</p>
<p>Second, we can simply get from the graph that men earn higher average wages than women, regardless of whether they are married or not. Also, marriage has increased the wage gap between women and men, i.e. marriage is not a “blessing” but a “curse”.</p>
<p>Our group inferred an explanation for the “marriage curse”: first, the transition from single to married might decreases the probability that a woman will be trained , thus reducing the likelihood that she will earn a high wage after marriage. Second, it is marriage that reduces female labor force participation.</p>

<div id="conlusion-and-discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conlusion and Discussion</h2>
<p>According to our analysis, our parents are correct. Years of education can indeed help us make more money, but only with high degrees such as high school degree and college degree. Despite that, age is also a very important factor in terms of wage. If someone finished college at 40, it might be harder than a younger one when finding a job with considerable payment. Lastly, gender is still a factor considered in getting paid. Whether this is because of the sexism in the society or just coincidence, this huge gap should be diminished.</p>
<p>Here is our interactive page, which will provide you with a more concrete understanding of our analysis.</p>
<p>#Interactive
In order to understand this analysis and explore the income, educational level and poverty rate interaction, you can view our own explorer: <a href="https://xchen23.shinyapps.io/example/" class="uri">https://xchen23.shinyapps.io/example/</a>
This interactive feature allows you to select a certain state in the U.S. map, and by double clicking the area you want to learn, the information about a state’s median income, college completion rate and poverty rate will be popped up. It will be a great tool for us to learn about the general behavior of a certain state.</p>
